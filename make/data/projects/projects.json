		"description": "An analog readout board specifically intended for ultra fast pixels, containing multiple independent channels with 1 GHz wide band, 40 dB amplifiers. Two versions were produced with 4 and 16 channels respectively. Importance was given to produce a system easy to use and practical in the lab, which included a design with a main and a carrier boards. This turned out saving a lot of time and costs, since each pixel sensor can be mounted in a low cost, disposable board, while the main board is effortless reused. It became very popular among researchers from different institutions across Europe and very soon many people was using it for their own tests.",
